Description: # PFX
        PFX or Python-Effects is a PyPI Package which helps in Standard Imaging Techniques.
        
        ## How to download :
        Enter either of the pip commands on your console to install it.
        
        `pip install PFX` **or** `pip install pfx`
        
        
        ## How to use
        PFX can apply various effects to a given image
        Following commands can be used:
        
        > **The result will be saved in the same file path, a prompt will also be shown as to where the file is saved!**
        
        
        
        #### 1. To convert an image into black and white :
        ```
        pfx -bg "filepath.png"
        ```
        **or**
        ```
        pfx -black_white "filepath.png"
        ```
        
        #### 2. To pixelate the given image :
        ```
        pfx -p "filepath.png"
        ```
        **or**
        ```
        pfx -pixelate "filepath.png"
        ```
        #### 3. To blur the given image :
        ```
        pfx -b "filepath.png"
        ```
        **or**
        ```
        pfx -blur "filepath.png"
        ```
        #### 4. To blur the given image's edges :
        ```
        pfx -be "filepath.png"
        ```
        **or**
        ```
        pfx -bluredge "filepath.png"
        ```
        #### 5. To create a thumbnail of the given image :
        ```
        pfx -tn "filepath.png"
        ```
        **or**
        ```
        pfx -thumbnail "filepath.png"
        ```
        ## TL;DR 
        Just execute the following snippet if you have an IQ level above average :
        ```
        pfx -h
        ```
        Then figure it out yourself!
        ## Any Issues:
        - This is the first draft of the PYPI package.
        
        - This is prone to bugs. Let me know if any issues come up.
        
        - PFX is a dumb name, waiting for the real name's ownership to clear up.
        ## More imaging effects arriving soon...
        - Feel free to share any open ideas!
